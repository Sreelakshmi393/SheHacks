    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p id="text">I consider "SheHacks" as an opportunity where I can utilise my programming knowledge in a way which the current industry want. Being part of TinkerHub was a great experience for me from the beginning itself. The foundation of my most of the growth was laid by TinkerHub. So I consider this "SheHacks" too as an opportunity for my growth. As a part of building a project I can use my knowledge and I can improve my skills with my team members and also  with the support of experienced mentors from TinkerHub. As this TinkerHub designed this as a recurring program I'm confident that this will be a great chance for everyone to learn and build something of industrial standard.</p>
    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <p id="text">Everyone wants to excel in their own career. All of us wants to become an expert in our respective field. In IT sector the most valuable thing is the skill. I believe that skills will not come to us easily. We have to acquire that by getting our hands dirty. Constant handwork and consistency are the most important things to conquer any skill. I strongly believe that "SheHacks" will help me in skill building and maintaining consistency with the recurrence  of the program.  That will ultimately help in getting more confidence and knowledge in the respective stack.</p>

    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p id="text">I think it's a great opportunity to study my area of interest with mentor's aid. So my mission is to make maximum utilisation of this opportunity, to grab and acquire skills that I am currently weak, upgrade myself with technical updations through projects and other works from "SheHacks". I aim to complete all the tasks with my team members before the deadline since I have an ardent desire to be with the community till its end.</p>
    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <p id="text">Being a BCA graduate I dream to be a part of a good company, so for that I must certainaly get my hands dirty and have some experiences as well. I hope "SheHacks" could contirbute a lot to this. I expect SheHacks will come up with tasks that are in connection with the latest IT scenario. Also, I believe that at the end I'll be grateful for being a part of this program.</p>
